# AP-Final

My AP computer science project.

A tool to manage unorganized notes, to allow for rapped note taking, without wasting time on planning. Notes is a command line tool, that allows for fast note taking, without worrying about where you are going to save it. Notes allows you to use your favorite text editing program.

# Goals

# Context

## Definitions

User – The person using the command line tool.

Note – Small amount of information, that needs to be referenced later.

Overhead - Overhead is the questions asked when taking a note.

1. Where to save the note.
2. What to what to call the note.

Notes is trying to solve the time-consuming overhead of note organization.

Notes solves this by first, being a command line to that can be used anytime, without searching for the program.

Notes solves the problem of where to save the note, by storing the notes in a database. Where are your notes? They are in the database.

It solves what to what to call the note, in a few ways. First the note is given a unique id when put into the database. All notes will have a name this way, without the User having to think. But this brings up a new problem. How will the User find the notes there looking for?

The User will be able to assign each note a list of tags. The User can then search their notes, by searching the tags.
